# Hypothyroid-prediction-
Tasked with coming up with a model that will enable us to predict hypothyroidism given various features and classify whether patients will test positive for hypothyroidism or they will test negative for hypothyroidism t This project will be deemed successful if we can correctly and accurately predict and classify hypothyroidism cases as accurately as possible.

# Technologies Used
Being a modelling project, the project required performing various modelling techniques and making accurate predictions for hypothyroidism. We will use various libraries to work on our notebook.

# Support and contact details
In case of any querries, corrections or additions, feel free to reach me and share. Corrections are most welcome since I have just begun the journey and being pointed in the right direction would actually go a long way in helping me grow and learn and become a better data scientist. The goal of data is insight and if you find insight that I didn't, do let me know.

The dataset for this project can be found here: http://bit.ly/hypothyroid_data
